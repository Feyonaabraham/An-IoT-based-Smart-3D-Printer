# An-IoT-based-Smart-3D-Printer
3D printing is an additive manufacturing technique in which 3D objects are printed with the help of CAD/CAM Software.  The main objective of our project was to design and develop an IoT based smart 3D printer which can be used to print things remotely and monitor the performance of the 3D printer. With the help of this smart 3D printer, you can remotely load new prints, monitor your extruder temperature,turn your printer on and off, check the status of your prints, and watch your prints with a live video feed , control the activities of printer using Blynk Application and more... When an increasing  number of 3D printer operators are looking for the ways to use their 3D printer remotely, this Wireless Smart 3D printer has a number of advantages over the traditional wired setup. Instead of SD cards you can use Wi-Fi network to send G-codes. Moreover we were able to design this Smart 3D printer more affordable than the traditional one. Another purpose of this project was to resolve the overheating issues of the MOSFET.
